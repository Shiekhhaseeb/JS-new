🧠 Shadowing means:
A variable in an inner block has the same name as a variable in an outer block.
The inner one hides or “shadows” the outer one — like clouds hiding the sun. ☁️🌞

✅ Example using let (true shadowing):

let fruit = "apple";

{
  let fruit = "banana"; // 🍌 Shadows the "apple"
  console.log("Inside block:", fruit); // banana
}

console.log("Outside block:", fruit); // apple
🧒 Imagine this:
At home, your favorite fruit is apple.

But in class, your teacher says your favorite fruit is banana.

While in class, you go with banana.

But when you go back home, it’s still apple.

That’s shadowing! The banana (inside block) only covers the apple (outside) while you're in the block.

❗ Shadowing doesn’t work with var like this:

var fruit = "apple";

{
  var fruit = "banana"; // ❌ No shadowing — just overwrites!
  console.log("Inside block:", fruit); // banana
}

console.log("Outside block:", fruit); // banana (not apple anymore)
Because var doesn’t respect blocks — it uses the same variable.

✅ So, real shadowing happens with:
let

const

Not with var.

Imagine this:

🎒 You have a school bag named a.
You put 100 candies inside it.

var a = 100;
Now, you go into your classroom (that’s like a block { ... }).

Inside the classroom, you again say:

"Hey! I have a bag named a, and I’m putting 10 candies in it."

But this time, instead of giving you a new bag, the teacher says:

“No need for a new bag! You already have a bag called a, just change what’s inside.”


{
  var a = 10; // Same bag, candies changed from 100 to 10!
}
So, when you come out of the classroom, and look in your bag again:


console.log(a); // You find only 10 candies
Because you used **var**, it’s like using the same bag everywhere in school — even in different rooms!

Now let’s talk about let or const — they're smarter! 🎓
Let’s try again:

let a = 100;
{
  let a = 10;
  console.log(a); // 10 candies in your **new classroom bag**
}
console.log(a); // 100 candies in your **outside bag**
When you say let a = 10; inside the classroom, the teacher gives you a new bag, just for the classroom!

So when you leave the room, you still have your original bag with 100 candies 🎉

🍭 TL;DR for 5th Grade Genius:
var = same bag everywhere 👜 (candies can get replaced!)

let and const = new bags in each room 🎒 (your outside candies stay safe!)
