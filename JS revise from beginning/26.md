AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) ‚Äî which is how JavaScript makes HTTP requests to servers without reloading the page.

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step from scratch using XMLHttpRequest (the old-school way).
üß† What is AJAX?

AJAX = JavaScript technique to send/receive data from a server without refreshing the webpage.

We usually use it to:

    Fetch data (GET)

    Send form data (POST)

    Talk to APIs

‚úÖ Step-by-Step AJAX using XMLHttpRequest
‚úÖ 1. Create an Object

const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr is now your remote controller that sends HTTP requests.

    This is like saying: "Hey browser, give me a new request handler."

‚úÖ 2. Open the Request

xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");

    "GET" ‚Üí HTTP method (can be "POST", "PUT", "DELETE" etc.)

    URL ‚Üí Where you want to send the request.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è It doesn't send the request yet ‚Äî just prepares it.

‚úÖ 3. Send the Request

xhr.send();

    Now the request is actually sent to the server.

‚úÖ 4. Track Request Progress

xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log("Response:", xhr.responseText);
  }
};

üîç What is xhr.readyState?
State	Value	         Meaning
0	  UNSENT	         Request not initialized
1	  OPENED	         Request has been set up (open called)
2	  HEADERS_RECEIVED	Response headers received
3	  LOADING	        Response is loading (partial data)
4	  DONE	            Request completed, response is ready ‚úÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

    xhr.responseText is plain text ‚Üí parse it using JSON.parse(xhr.responseText) if needed.

    status === 200 means success (HTTP OK).

    xhr is old method ‚Üí today, we prefer fetch() or libraries like Axios.
    /*************************************/
    ‚úÖ 1. GET

    Purpose: To retrieve data from the server.

    Example use: Load a user profile, blog post, or product list.

    AJAX line:

    xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data");

‚úÖ 2. POST

    Purpose: To send data to the server (e.g., form submission).

    Example use: Submitting a login form or a comment.

    AJAX line:

    xhr.open("POST", "https://api.example.com/login");

‚úÖ 3. PUT

    Purpose: To update existing data on the server (replace entire object).

    Example use: Updating a user's full profile info.

    AJAX line:

    xhr.open("PUT", "https://api.example.com/users/1");

‚úÖ 4. PATCH

    Purpose: To partially update data (modify only a part of the object).

    Example use: Changing only the user's email.

    AJAX line:

    xhr.open("PATCH", "https://api.example.com/users/1");

‚úÖ 5. DELETE

    Purpose: To delete data on the server.

    Example use: Deleting a comment or user.

    AJAX line:

    xhr.open("DELETE", "https://api.example.com/posts/1");

Summary Table:
HTTP Method	Action	Used For
GET	Fetch data	Load info (read)
POST	Send new data	Submit forms or create records
PUT	Replace data	Full update of existing record
PATCH	Update part of data	Partial update
DELETE	Remove data	Delete from server

/**************************************/
‚úÖ Final Notes:

    Use console.log(typeof xhr.responseText) to see it‚Äôs a "string".

    To convert it to a real JavaScript object, you can use:

const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
console.log(data.title); // prints the title
