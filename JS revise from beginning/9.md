🎓 Functional Programming in JavaScript
🔰 Start: What is Functional Programming?
Functional Programming (FP) is a way of writing code where:

You build logic using functions.

You avoid changing data (no mutation).

You treat functions like values (pass them around, return them, store them).

You write cleaner, predictable code.

It’s more about the style of writing code than the language itself. JavaScript supports FP principles even though it’s not a "pure" functional language like Haskell.

✅ Imperative vs Declarative Programming
👨‍🔧 Imperative (how you do it)
You tell the computer step-by-step how to do something.


let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let doubled = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    doubled.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
Like teaching a robot each move: “Go there, do this, now that…”

🧙 Declarative (what you want)
You say what you want, not how to do it.

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
Like telling your assistant: “Get me doubled numbers.” They figure out how.

🔹 Pure Functions
A pure function is like a good student — always gives the same answer if you give the same input, and never causes trouble (no side effects).

✅ Rules for Pure Functions:
Same input ➡ same output

No modifying global state or variables

No side effects like console.log, alert, file writing

📌 Example of Pure Function:

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;  // No side effects
}
❌ Impure Function:

let count = 0;

function increment() {
    count++;             // Side effect: changes outer variable
    return count;
}
🔥 Side Effects
Side effects = Anything a function does outside itself.
🎯 What Is a Side Effect?
A side effect is anything a function does beyond just returning a value.

That includes:

Changing a global variable

Printing to the console

Updating the DOM (in browsers)

Writing to a file or sending a network request

Modifying anything outside the function

🧼 A Function With No Side Effects (Pure Function)
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
✅ This function is pure:

No console log

No global variable changes

No API calls

It just returns a value

🔥 A Function With Side Effects
javascript
Copy code
let total = 0;

function addToTotal(a) {
    total += a;               // ❌ modifies external variable
    console.log(total);       // ❌ prints something (side effect)
}
This function:

Changes the outer variable total

Logs to the console

➡ These are both side effects.

⚠️ Why Are Side Effects “Dangerous”?
They make code:

Harder to debug (because something changed unexpectedly)

Less predictable

Harder to test

🎬 Real-Life Example:
Without side effect:
javascript
Copy code
function calculateTax(price) {
    return price * 0.1;
}
With side effect:
javascript
Copy code
let totalTax = 0;

function calculateAndStoreTax(price) {
    const tax = price * 0.1;
    totalTax += tax;  // ❌ modifies outside state
    console.log(tax); // ❌ logs to console
}
✅ Quick Summary
Side Effect Example	Why it's a Side Effect
console.log(...)	Affects console (outside)
Modifying global variables	Changes external state
DOM manipulation	Affects web page outside code
API calls	Communicates with outside
File writing	Affects disk


Examples:
Modifying a global variable

Printing to console

Writing to a file

Making a network request

These make functions less predictable.


🧠 Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)
A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

📌 Examples:
map, filter, reduce in JavaScript

You can also write your own HOFs!

Example 1: map
javascript
Copy code
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
let squares = nums.map(n => n * n);  // map takes a function!
Example 2: Custom HOF
javascript
Copy code
function callTwice(fn) {
    fn();
    fn();
}

callTwice(() => console.log("Hello"));  // prints "Hello" twice
🧩 Function Composition
Combine small functions to make big ones — like LEGO blocks.

javascript
Copy code
const double = x => x * 2;
const square = x => x * x;

const doubleThenSquare = x => square(double(x));
console.log(doubleThenSquare(3));  // (3*2)^2 = 36
➡ This is clean and readable: build small, testable functions, and chain them together.

🔒 Closures
A closure is a function that “remembers” the variables from the scope it was created in — even after that scope is gone.

📌 Example:
javascript
Copy code
function outer() {
    let secret = 42;
    return function inner() {
        console.log(secret);  // inner "closes over" `secret`
    };
}

const reveal = outer();
reveal();  // 42
🔑 Why it matters in interviews:
Used in data hiding

Helps create private variables

Essential in callbacks & asynchronous code

🍛 Currying
Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a chain of functions that take one argument at a time.

Normal Function:
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
Curried Version:
javascript
Copy code
function curriedAdd(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a + b;
    };
}

const add5 = curriedAdd(5);  // returns a function
console.log(add5(3));        // 8
With Arrow Functions (🔥):
javascript
Copy code
const curriedAdd = a => b => a + b;
console.log(curriedAdd(10)(2));  // 12
Why Currying?
Code reusability

Better function composition

Common in functional libraries like Ramda, Lodash

🏁 Summary Table
Concept	Meaning
Imperative	Code tells how to do something
Declarative	Code tells what you want
Pure Function	No side effects, same input → same output
Side Effect	External change (e.g., log, write, modify state)
HOF	Function that takes/returns another function
Composition	Combine small functions to make complex ones
Closure	Inner function remembering outer variables
Currying	Split multi-arg function into chained 1-arg functions
