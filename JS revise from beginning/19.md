🧠 What is Event Propagation?

    Event propagation is how the browser decides the order in which elements react when you click something inside nested elements.

🎯 Simple Example:

Imagine you have this:

<div id="outer">
  <div id="inner">
    <button id="btn">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</div>

You click the button. The event doesn't just affect the button — it travels through the HTML structure in two directions:
🔽 Capturing Phase (Top to Bottom)

    Starts from the <html> or document

    Goes down through outer → inner → button

You can "catch" the event on its way down.
🎯 Target Phase

    It reaches the actual element that was clicked (the button).

🔼 Bubbling Phase (Bottom to Top)

    The event bubbles up from the button

    Goes back up through inner → outer → document

You can "catch" the event on its way up (this is what usually happens by default).
📝 In Simple Words:

    Event propagation is the way a browser handles a click or action, moving from the outermost elements to the target, and then back up — like a wave going in and out.

🧪 Real-Life Example:

Think of throwing a pebble in water:

    Ripples go inwards → capturing phase

    Pebble hits water → target phase

    Ripples go outwards → bubbling phase

✅ What Are Events in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, events are actions that happen in the browser — like a user clicking a button, hovering, pressing a key, etc.

You can listen for these events and run your own code when they happen. This is done using event listeners.

element.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // your code here
});

🔁 What Is Event Propagation?

When an event occurs (like clicking a button), it doesn’t just stay there — it travels through the DOM in a specific path. This is called event propagation and it has two main phases:
1. Capturing Phase (Event Capturing)

    The event starts at the window and moves down the DOM tree toward the target element.

    You can catch the event on its way down.

2. Target Phase

    The event reaches the target element (the one that was actually clicked).

3. Bubbling Phase (Event Bubbling)

    The event bubbles up from the target element back to the top (document/window).

    You can catch the event on its way up.

🧠 Think of Propagation Like This:

    You throw a stone into a pond. First the ripples go inward (capturing) toward the stone, then they go outward (bubbling).

🔥 Code Example (Bubbling vs Capturing)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Event Propagation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="outer" style="padding: 30px; background: lightblue;">
      Outer Div
      <div id="inner" style="padding: 30px; background: lightgreen;">
        Inner Div
        <button id="btn">Click Me</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Bubbling (default - false)
      document.getElementById('outer').addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log('Outer Div Clicked - Bubbling');
      });

      document.getElementById('inner').addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log('Inner Div Clicked - Bubbling');
      });

      document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log('Button Clicked');
      });

      // Capturing (pass true as third parameter)
      document.getElementById('outer').addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log('Outer Div Clicked - Capturing');
      }, true);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

🧾 Output When You Click the Button:

Outer Div Clicked - Capturing
Button Clicked
Inner Div Clicked - Bubbling
Outer Div Clicked - Bubbling

💬 How to Explain in Interview (Impressive Answer)

    In JavaScript, when an event is fired, it goes through three phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. Event capturing goes top-down, bubbling goes bottom-up. By default, JavaScript uses bubbling. However, we can catch events in the capturing phase by passing true as the third argument in addEventListener. This gives developers fine control over how events are handled across nested elements. This is powerful in event delegation and when building reusable components.

✅ Summary Points for Interview

    addEventListener(type, callback, useCapture)

        useCapture = true → Capturing

        useCapture = false (default) → Bubbling

    Useful for event delegation, preventing unwanted propagation, and performance optimization.

    Use event.stopPropagation() to stop event from going further.

📚 THEORY: Event Propagation
3 Phases:

    Capturing Phase – top to bottom (root to target)

    Target Phase – event hits the actual element

    Bubbling Phase – bottom to top (target to root)

By Default:

    JavaScript uses bubbling

    You can enable capturing by passing true in addEventListener

element.addEventListener("click", callback, true); // capturing

🧪 PRACTICE CODE – Bubbling & Capturing

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Event Propagation</title>
  <style>
    .outer {
      padding: 40px;
      background-color: lightblue;
    }
    .inner {
      padding: 30px;
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }
    .button {
      padding: 15px;
      background-color: peachpuff;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="outer" id="outerDiv">
    Outer Div
    <div class="inner" id="innerDiv">
      Inner Div
      <button class="button" id="targetBtn">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    const outer = document.getElementById('outerDiv');
    const inner = document.getElementById('innerDiv');
    const button = document.getElementById('targetBtn');

    // BUBBLING (default: false)
    outer.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Outer Div - BUBBLING');
    });

    inner.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Inner Div - BUBBLING');
    });

    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Button Clicked');
    });

    // CAPTURING (third param: true)
    outer.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Outer Div - CAPTURING');
    }, true);
  </script>
</body>
</html>

🛑 BONUS: Stop Propagation Example

button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation(); // stops event from going to inner or outer
  console.log('Button clicked - propagation stopped');
});

📝 RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FLOW

    Try just the button click

    Add inner div and observe bubbling

    Add capturing listener

    Try stopPropagation() and observe behavior

📌 Summary for Interview

    Events bubble up the DOM by default.

    You can catch events on their way down using capturing.

    You can use stopPropagation() to prevent the event from reaching parent elements.

    This is essential in cases like modal popups, nested elements, or component-based apps.
