ðŸ”¹ 4. API Request & V8 Engine

    The V8 engine (used by Chrome & Node.js) runs JS code.

    JS is single-threaded, but it handles async tasks using a callback queue + event loop.

    API requests (like fetch) go out, and their result comes later.
    The V8 engine, developed by Google, is a core component in web browsers like Chrome and server-side environments like Node.js. It's responsible for parsing and executing JavaScript code. When JavaScript code needs to interact with external resources or APIs, it does so by communicating with the browser's or environment's runtime, which then handles the actual API request. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. V8 and JavaScript Execution:
V8 is a JavaScript engine, meaning it's the core component that interprets and runs JavaScript code. 
It handles tasks like compiling JavaScript to machine code, managing memory for JavaScript objects, and garbage collection. 
V8 executes the logic within JavaScript code, including any API calls. 
2. Web APIs and Browser/Environment Runtime:
Web APIs (like fetch, XMLHttpRequest, etc.) are provided by the browser or the Node.js environment, not directly by V8.
When JavaScript code needs to make an API request, it uses these Web APIs, which are part of the larger runtime environment. 
3. Interaction between V8 and Web APIs:
JavaScript code running in V8 can call functions provided by Web APIs.
For example, a fetch() call in JavaScript code will be executed by V8, but the actual network request is handled by the browser's or Node.js's runtime environment.
The browser or environment then interacts with the external API and returns the response.
V8 receives the response from the runtime and handles it within the JavaScript code. 
4. V8 in Different Contexts:
Browsers:
In browsers like Chrome, V8 executes JavaScript code within the browser's rendering engine (Blink). 
Node.js:
Node.js uses V8 as its JavaScript runtime, allowing developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. 
Other Embeddings:
V8 can also be embedded into other applications to provide JavaScript execution capabilities. 
In essence, V8 is the engine that powers the execution of JavaScript, including the logic for making API requests. However, the actual process of making those requests and handling the responses is done by the surrounding browser or runtime environment, which provides the necessary Web APIs.
