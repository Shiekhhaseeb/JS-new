🔹 1. Blocking vs Non-Blocking Code
⛔ Blocking Code (Synchronous)

Means one thing runs at a time. Next line waits till the current line is done.

console.log("Start");
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {} // takes time
console.log("End");

➡ Output:

Start
End   (after some delay)

✅ Non-Blocking Code (Asynchronous)

Some tasks (like timers, API calls) don’t block the next lines.

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("After 2 sec");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");

➡ Output:

Start
End
After 2 sec

⏳ The setTimeout runs after the rest is done, and doesn't block.
