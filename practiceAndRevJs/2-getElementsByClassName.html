        /*In HTML, by default, a <p> (paragraph) element behaves like a block-level element. This means it takes up the full width of its container (usually the body of the webpage) unless otherwise specified. So when you add a background color, it might cover the whole width of the page.*/ 

/*An HTMLCollection is similar to an array, but it's not exactly the same. It contains a list of elements(key-value pair), and you can access each element in it using indexing (like an array), which is why note1[0] looks like it's an array.

However, it's not a true JavaScript array. It's more like a list of elements.*/
