    <!-- 🧠 Think of your webpage like a school building.
    Inside this building (your HTML page), there are rooms (like <p> tags, <div>, buttons, images, etc.).
    
    Now, when you want to find something inside the building, like "all the paragraphs (<p>) on the page," you need to start from somewhere.
    
    💡 That “somewhere” is document
    document is like the principal's office that knows everything in the school (the webpage).
    
    It can see and control every room (every element) in the building. -->
    <!-- window.document.getElementsByTagName('p'); -->

    <!-- 0000000111111111111111111111111111111111111 -->

    <!-- 🧠 Breaking it down:
window = the big browser window (like the whole screen)

document = the web page inside that window (the book)

getElementsByTagName('p') = find all the tags that are <p> (paragraphs)

const paragraphs = ... = save all of those paragraphs in a box called paragraphs -->
