🧠 What is AJAX?
AJAX stands for:

Asynchronous
JavaScript
And
XML (but we use JSON now, not XML)

📦 But what does that mean?
Let’s pretend your webpage is like a school notebook 📖.
And the server (computer where data lives) is like the teacher’s office 🏫.

🧸 Without AJAX:
If you wanted to ask the teacher something (get new data), you’d have to:

Close your notebook (refresh the page 🔁)

Go to the teacher’s office (server)

Come back and open a new notebook

👎 That’s slow and annoying, right?

🚀 With AJAX:
Now imagine...
You can just raise your hand 🙋 in class and say:

"Hey teacher, what's the weather today?"

And the teacher (server) replies while your notebook stays open!

That’s AJAX!


✅ AJAX lets your webpage:
Ask for new data

Without refreshing the whole page

Using JavaScript in the background
