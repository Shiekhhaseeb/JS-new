Great question, detective coder! 🕵️‍♂️🧒
You're trying to understand why you're always seeing readyState: 4 when using xhr.onload. Let’s make this super clear — step by step — like you're in 5th class!

✅ First, here’s your code again:

xhr.onload = () => {
  const data = JSON.parse(xhr.response);
};
❓ Question: Why do we only get readyState === 4 here?
👉 Because .onload only runs when the request is DONE — and that means:

readyState === 4

📖 Think of it like this:
Imagine your mailman (XHR) is delivering a package 📦

He leaves your house → 🏃 (state 1)

Sends the request to GitHub → 📮 (state 2)

Server starts sending back data → 📡 (state 3)

Finally: package is fully delivered → ✅ (state 4)

When you use:

xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  console.log(xhr.readyState);
}
👉 You see all states: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 as they happen.

But when you use:

xhr.onload = function () { ... }
👉 This only runs when everything is finished. So you're jumping directly to state 4, because:

🎯 xhr.onload === “when it’s all done (state 4), do this!”
🧁 5th Class Summary:
Thing you use	What it does	When it runs
xhr.onreadystatechange	Tracks every step 🐾	0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
xhr.onload	Runs only when done 🎯	At readyState === 4
