🧠 What is an API?
API stands for:
Application Programming Interface

📦 Simple meaning:
An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. 🍽️
You tell the waiter what you want (order) ➜ they bring it from the kitchen ➜ and give it to you.

In JavaScript, you (the browser) ask for data from a server using an API.

✅ Real-life Example:
Let’s say you're building a weather app.

Your JavaScript says:

"Hey weather API! Give me today’s temperature for Delhi!"

Then the API replies:

"Sure! It’s 38°C and sunny ☀️"

👨‍💻 In JavaScript, we often use:
🔧 fetch() → Built-in tool to call APIs

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json(); // convert to readable data
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log(data); // show the data
  });
🎯 So in short:
An API is a way to talk to another program (like a server), and fetch() is how we do it in JavaScript.

💡 explanation:
You do this	It’s like...
Call an API	Telling the waiter your food order 🍕
Get a response	Waiter brings your food 🥤
Use fetch()	Sending the request
response.json()	Unpacking the food box 📦
