🧠 What is Date.now() really showing?
Date.now() gives you the number of milliseconds since a date called:

January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
(That’s called the Unix Epoch — computers love it!)

So this:
Date.now() => 1715524095893
Means:

"This many milliseconds have passed since 1970!"

But... you want to see real time, like:
Hitesh 10:30:45
✅ Let’s Fix It — Show Time Properly!
Replace this:

console.log("Hitesh", Date.now());
With this:

console.log("Hitesh", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
📦 Explanation:
new Date() → gives the current date & time.

.toLocaleTimeString() → formats it like a real human clock (e.g. 10:45:33 AM).

📆 Imagine a Giant Stopwatch 🕰️
Let’s pretend computers have a giant invisible stopwatch.

And on January 1, 1970, someone said:

🧑‍🔧 “Ready... Set... GO!” and started the stopwatch!

From that moment, the computer has been counting time in:

👉 Milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds)

So when you see this:

Date.now() // ➜ 1715524095893
That number means:

"That many tiny ticks have happened since 1970!"

🧮 Why this is easy for computers?
Because computers love numbers.
They don’t like fancy stuff like:

❌ March 12, 2025, 4:08 PM
✅ 1,715,524,095,893 (a big number!)

🎯 Why pick 1970?
Because it's a nice round time from long ago.
It’s like saying:

“Let’s all start counting from zero — and we’ll call that year 1970.”

Every computer in the world knows:

“The timer starts at Jan 1, 1970 — that’s our Day 0!”

🕹️ So when you use Date.now():
It’s like asking the computer:

“Hey! How long has your stopwatch been running?”

And it gives you the big number of milliseconds.

🧁 Just like...
A cake timer counts seconds since you started it 🎂

A computer counts milliseconds since 1970

That’s why computers "love" 1970 — it’s their birthday for time! 🎉

Awesome! 🤩 Let's check in your browser’s console that the computer starts counting time from 1970 — just like we talked about!

✅ Simple Code to See 1970 in the Console:

const date = new Date(0);
console.log(date);
🧠 What this does:
new Date(0) means:
➤ “Show me the date when the clock started — at 0 milliseconds.”

And guess what?
➤ It will show: Thu Jan 01 1970 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

💡 Try It:
Open your browser

Right-click on the page → Inspect

Go to the Console tab

Paste this:
console.log(new Date(0));
🖥️ You’ll see:

Thu Jan 01 1970 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
🥳 See? That’s the magical starting point — the Unix Epoch.
