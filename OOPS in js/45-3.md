🎯 Key Idea:
A class is a blueprint. An object is the real thing.

📖 The Story You Can Tell:
Imagine you have a blueprint to make toy robots.
That blueprint is called User.

Now...

You don’t play with the blueprint.
You use it to make a robot.

You make a robot by saying:


const hitesh = new User("hitesh");
Now hitesh is a real robot that has:

a name

the ability to speak his name

an ID card

If you want the robot to talk, you say:


hitesh.logMe(); // "Username: hitesh"
If you want the robot's ID:


hitesh.createId(); // "123"

But you can’t do this:
User.createId(); // ❌ Error!
Because the blueprint doesn’t talk or have an ID — only real robots do.

🧠 Simple Trick to Remember:
❗ Blueprint (class) = idea, cannot do actions
✅ Object (like hitesh) = real thing, can do all the actions

💬 So, if someone asks:
"Why hitesh.createId() and not User.createId()?"

You say:

“Because only real users can do actions. The class is just a design — it can’t do anything on its own.”

A  simple one-line rhyme to memorize it forever? 🎵

🎵
"A class is a plan, not the man —
Only the object does what it can!"
🎵

💬 What it means:
The class (plan) is just the idea

The object (like hitesh) is the real thing that can do stuff like talk, walk, show ID, etc.
