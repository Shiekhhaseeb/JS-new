do we always need to call constructor inside class

Great question! 🧠 Let's keep it simple, like you're still in 5th grade and I'm still your Oxford professor with a chalk in hand. 🧑‍🏫

🚪 What Is a constructor?
Think of the constructor like the entrance door to a new toy or character.

When you make a new user:


const chai = new User("chai", "chai@gmail.com", "123");
That new User(...) automatically looks for the constructor to build the object.

❓Do We Always Need a Constructor?
Nope!

You only need a constructor if you want to give some starting values when you create your object (like name, email, password).

🧸 Example WITHOUT constructor:

class Dog {
  bark() {
    return "Woof!";
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
console.log(myDog.bark()); // Output: Woof!
✅ This works without a constructor
Because we didn’t need to set anything like a name or age at the beginning.

✅ Use Constructor When:
You want to pass data when creating an object

Like setting name, email, password, age, etc.

❌ You can skip Constructor When:
You don’t need to set anything in the beginning

🧠 Super Simple Rule:
Constructor is like packing your bag before a trip. If you need stuff inside, use it. If you're just going for a walk, skip it!
